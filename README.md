Javascript code for web elements dimension optimizing


Hi. I'm Silvia Malavasi, web designer. I always fight with giving html elements the right size and center when designing a full screen website. This little script allow you to have your div centered and full sized and still keep its original aspect razio. No cuts and no stretches, just the maximum width or height your screen allows.
